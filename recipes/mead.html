    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mead is, quite literally, the drink of the gods. Made from pure honey, water, and yeast; fermented to perfection.</p>
    <p>But great mead only comes to those who wait. A key principle in meadmaking is <em>resting</em> the mead after it is fully
    fermented. This resting period is crucial to reduce the amount of complex alcohols that are formed during the fermentation phase.</p>
    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pure bee honey (preferably from a single origin)</li>
        <li>Pristine water, fresh from the well</li>
        <li>White wine yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix honey with warm water in the desired proportion.</li>
        <li>After the mixture cools down, add yeast and mix well.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to ferment for two weeks (or until no yeast activity).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a new bottle and let it rest for two month, at least.</li>
        <li>Bottle the mead and allow it to rest in the bottle for two more months.</li>
    </ol>
